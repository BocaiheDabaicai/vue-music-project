<p>Another exercise heading your way! On the audio player, we're changing the play button's appearance by changing the icon from&nbsp; to  and vice versa. This behavior is based on if the audio is playing or not. This behavior should also be reflected on the page for the song. We have a big "play"&nbsp;button on the page that should change too. Try tackling this change; the process is the same, including the icons. Once you've got it figured out, let us know by sharing in the <strong>#vue</strong> channel :) </p>
