<p>Wow, that was pretty easy to deploy wasn't it? That's the beauty of Vercel + Vue! Now, we still have a few more sections to go, but I want you to take some time now to reflect on what you have built, what you have learned, and see how you can add some extra functionality to the project. Maybe you want to make some new styling updates? Perhaps add the ability to "Like" a song? <br><br>We want to see how creative you can get! Once you have your own version of the project, share it with your other classmates in our<strong> #vue</strong> channel on Discord and you can even tweet at us: <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreiNeagoie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@AndreiNeagoie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VanillaJSDev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@VanillaJSDev (Luis)</a> with your projects so we can check it out.<br><br>Have fun and can't wait to see your version of the app :)</p>
