<p>Hey everyone! This would be a good opportunity to add your own personal touch to the project by giving you an exercise. We've validated a lot of fields thus far. How about adding another one to the registration form? What additional piece of information can you ask from the user? For example, maybe you can ask if they're a listener or artist as a dropdown option.&nbsp;Feel free to enforce any rules you'd like. Be sure to insert the data into Firestore post-submission. Once you've got that done, show us what you came up with by sharing in our <strong>#vue</strong> channel on discord and show others what you have done :)</p>
